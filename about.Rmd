**Graduate Student and Sustainable Water Markets Fellow**

*UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management* 

*Focus*: Economics and Politics of the Environment, Strategic Environmental Communication

My interests lie in finding actionable solutions to move the needle on water supply security in the western United States. Born and raised on the Colorado Plateau- a landscape marked by the passage and absence of water- I learned the value of water at an early age. Building on a background in field hydrology, I bridge the gap between scientists, users and managers to protect the water resources that are the bedrock of the West. 

I hope to leverage my technical expertise and experience as a Sustainable Water Markets fellow to accelerate public and private investment in quantifiable solutions to protect and promote our thriving West. 

When I'm not behind the screen, you'll catch me soaking in the sun exploring the dusty corners of the southwest.
