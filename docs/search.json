Building on a background in field hydrology, I hope to bridge the gap between scientist, users and managers to protect the water resources that are the bedrock of the West.\nI hope to leverage my experience as a Sustainable Water Markets fellow and technical expertise to accelerate private investment in public resources focused on quantifiable outcomes.\nWhen I’m not behind the screen, you’ll catch me soaking in the sun exploring the dusty corners of the southwest.\n\n\n\n",
